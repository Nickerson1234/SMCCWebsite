            <p>In 1948, NASIPIT was still a part of the Parish of Buenavista, whose Parish Priest was the late Fr. Martin Westeinde, a Dutch MSC. As the town progressed, population also increased and business gained momentum with the start of the logging industry of the Nasipit Lumber Company (NALCO). Fr. Martin and his co-adjurer Fr. Atanacio de Castro saw the need of putting-up a secondary school. Fr. De Castro was made in charge of the school.

                    It started its operation on July 1, 1948, with Rev. Fr. Francisco Van Dyke as the first Director. He was succeeded by Rev. Fr. Enrique Van Ma-anen, Rev. Fr. Vicente Portillo, Rev. Fr. Mateo Van Santvoord, and Rev. Fr. Anthony Krol in the order of succession. Rev. Fr. Krol was the last Dutch priest who served as the school director.
                    
                    The school site is beside the rectory with an area of 1,630 sq.m. Fr. Gerard Cruisjen, one of the subsequent Directors converted the nipa-wooden structure into a concrete two-storey building with 16 classrooms.
                    
                    When the Filipinization Law was implemented in 1975 a layman (now deceased) Mr. Gregorio Orias, became the first layman School Director until he retired in 1977. He was followed by Mr. Antonio L. Suarez, the first layman Director/Principal of the school. Faro Gatchalian followed until 1985 then Mrs. Necita Lim took the helm of the Directorship until 1991 while acting also as the Principal of St. James High School of Buenavista, an adjacent town of Nasipit . In 1991, Fr. Achilles Ayaton became the School Director until 1993. In 1994, Msgr. Cesar L. Gatela took over the School's Directorship until 1999 when he succumbed to a cardiac arrest in Cebu City. In his term, he opened the Pre-School Department with Sister Minah B. Hijada as the Administrator and he bought 19 computers integrating the Computer Technology subject to all levels of the High School Department.
                    
                    The Teatro, Sayaw, at Awit Production (TESAW Production) Center of the Michaelinian Performing Arts was established on June 01, 1997 with Dr. Dennis P. Mausisa as the Founder and Artistic Director.
                    
                    In 1999, after the sudden death of Msgr. Gatela, Msgr. Juan de Dios Pueblos, the bishop of Butuan appointed Msgr. Bienvenido A. Betaizar as the School Director who was later on promoted as School President until at present</p>
